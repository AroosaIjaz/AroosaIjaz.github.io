Summary: 

* Using random quantum circuit ansatz with random initialization for VQE leads to the barren plateau phenomenon. These observations suggest that an effective ansatz for VQE requires a circuit that is problem specific.

* Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) breaks down hamiltonian into many non-commuting terms (QAOA has two of these). We start with the ground state of one of these terms. These terms are applied p times (depth p circuit). 

* TFIM model: H = Hzz + gHx 
2p parameters

* XXZ model: H = Hxx + Hyy + delta Hzz
