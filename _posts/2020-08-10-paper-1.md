Summary: 

* Paper suggests that HVA is highly expressive but yet structured enough to allow for efficient optimization. It finds that entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum can shed light onto the initialization and optimization properties of HVA in the context of the VQE algorithm.

* Using random quantum circuit ansatz with random initialization for VQE leads to the barren plateau phenomenon. These observations suggest that an effective ansatz for VQE requires a circuit that is problem specific.

* Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) breaks down hamiltonian into many non-commuting terms (QAOA has two of these). We start with the ground state of one of these terms. These terms are applied p times (depth p circuit). 

* TFIM model: H = Hzz + gHx. this needs 2p parameters

* XXZ model: H = Hxx + Hyy + delta Hzz. this needs 4p parameters

* This paper showed that ground state can be represented accurately with a depth of p = N/2 circuit for all values of system parameters (g, delta)

* Recap area laws for the entanglement entropy from https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.3773.pdf

* Through the study of the dynamics of entanglement spectrum during the optimization of the XXZ model, they find that initializing the HVA
near the identity operator enables a restricted and effective subspace during optimization that yields accurate approximations to the ground state with fast convergence. Furthermore, we show evidence that the gradient vanishing problem in HVA, especially if the HVA
is initialized near the identity operator, is mild or entirely absent in comparison to the random circuit ansatz

* They also explore the over-parameterization phenomena
in HVA and observe a “computational phase transition”
between an under-parameterized and over-parameterized
regime where the optimization landscape of HVA crosses
over to a regime with faster convergence and absence
of low-quality solutions
