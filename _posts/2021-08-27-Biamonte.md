Summary: 

* Paper suggests short-depth continuous variable algorithms for quantum compilation. Experiements with arbitrary Gaussian operations and Kerr non-linearities are done to show learnability. Theoretical claims for quantum learning theory in the continuous variable setting are made (for the first time). They claim advantages in 
sample complexity when using quantum states of light.
