Summary:  
Overview of some applications of machine learning
in condensed matter physics and quantum information. For example:
  * supervised machine learning with convolutional neural networks to learn a phase transition
  * unsupervised learning with restricted Boltzmann machines to perform quantum tomography
  * variational Monte Carlo with recurrent neural-networks for approximating the ground state of a many-body Hamiltonian.
