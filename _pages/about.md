# About Me
* I am a Physics Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo.
* My PhD supervisors are Juan Felipe Carrasquilla and Roger Melko
* My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and Physics, in particular quantum-enhanced machine learning and applications of classical machine learning in Physics.
* In the past, I have worked on:
    * QML algorithms for NISQ devices
    * Majorana Fermions for topological quantum computing
    * quantum transport in TMDCs
    * quantum optical effects in color centers in diamond
    * spectroscopy on quantum wells and quantum dots
