# About Me
* I am a Physics Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo.
* My PhD supervisors are Juan Felipe Carrasquilla and Roger Melko.
* affiliated graduate researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory
* affiliated graduate researcher at Vector Institute in Toronto.
* visiting graduate researcher at Jens Eisert's group at Freie University in Berlin (Jan-Apr 2024) 
* My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and Physics, in particular quantum learning theory, quantum-enhanced machine learning and applications of classical machine learning in many-body Physics.
* In the past, I have worked on:
    * Quantum learning theory 
    * QML algorithms for NISQ devices
    * Majorana Fermions for topological quantum computing
    * quantum transport in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
    * quantum optical effects in color centers in diamond
    * Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CQED) and spectroscopy in quantum wells and quantum dots
