# About Me
* I am a Physics Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo. 
* My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and Physics, in particular quantum-enhanced machine learning and classical ML applications in Physics.
* In the past, I have worked on developing QML algorithms for NISQ devices, Majorana Fermions for topological quantum computing, quantum transport in TMDCs, quantum optical effects in color centers in diamond and spectroscopy on quantum dots. 

# Academic Services
* Conference Reviewer: QTML 2020
* QC Community: QOSF mentorship program 2020, CCUWIP Toronto 2020 Keynote speaker  
* Software contributions: PennyLane, Strawberry Fields.
