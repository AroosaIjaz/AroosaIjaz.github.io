# About Me
* I am a Physics Ph.D. student at the University of Waterloo. 
* My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and Physics, in particular quantum-enhanced machine learning and classical ML applications in Physics.
* In the past, I have worked on topological superconductors, Majorana Fermions, solid-state quantum computing, quantum transport in monolayer TMDCs and quantum optical effects in color centers in diamond. 

# Academic Services
* Conference Reviewer: QTML 2020
* QC Community: QOSF mentorship program 2020, CCUWIP Toronto 2020 Keynote speaker
