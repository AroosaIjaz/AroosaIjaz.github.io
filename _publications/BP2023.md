## Abstract
A large amount of effort has recently been put into understanding the barren plateau phenomenon.
In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loud elephant in the room and ask a question
that has been hinted at by many but not explicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to
avoid barren plateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? We present strong
evidence that commonly used models with provable absence of barren plateaus are also classically
simulable, provided that one can collect some classical data from quantum devices during an initial
data acquisition phase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from a curse
of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up encoding the problem into
some small, classically simulable, subspaces. This sheds serious doubt on the non-classicality of
the information processing capabilities of parametrized quantum circuits for barren plateau-free
landscapes and on the possibility of superpolynomial advantages from running them on quantum
hardware. We end by discussing caveats in our arguments, the role of smart initializations, and by
highlighting new opportunities that our perspective raises.
