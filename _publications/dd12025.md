## Abstract
The double descent phenomenon challenges traditional statistical learning theory by revealing scenarios
where larger models do not necessarily lead to reduced performance on unseen data. While this counterin-
tuitive behavior has been observed in a variety of classical machine learning models, particularly modern neural
network architectures, it remains elusive within the context of quantum machine learning. In this work, we
analytically demonstrate that linear regression models in quantum feature spaces can exhibit double descent
behavior by drawing on insights from classical linear regression and random matrix theory. Additionally, our
numerical experiments on quantum kernel methods across different real-world datasets and system sizes fur-
ther confirm the existence of a test error peak, a characteristic feature of double descent. Our findings provide
evidence that quantum models can operate in the modern, overparameterized regime without experiencing over-
fitting, potentially opening pathways to improved learning performance beyond traditional statistical learning
theory.
