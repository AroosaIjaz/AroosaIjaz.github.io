This talk was part of a [Physics camp](https://physicscamp4girls.pk/) aimed at inspiring high school girls from all over Pakistan about physics and STEM careers.
In Pakistan, science education teaches only classical physics upto high school and quantum mechanics is introduced much later at university level education.
Lack of industry infrastructure and funding for this field means that a very small number of people choose to study physics at advanced levels and even fewer people 
choose it as a career. Hence, there is potentially a huge lack of knowledge and interest in the general society regarding physics and how it is changing the world.
My talk was to motivate young girls about quantum computing and its wonderfully exciting applications and their potential impact on technology and the society we live in.
