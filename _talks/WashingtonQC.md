This is an introductory scientific talk on Quantum Machine Learning (QML). It was delivered as a webinar for the Washington Quantum Computing meetup on 27-04-2020. It looks at the principles of quantum mechanics that can be used to do machine learning and lists the various current directions of research in this field. There is also an introduction to the software PennyLane with examples. Some basic knowledge of linear algebra and quantum mechanics should suffice.
