We were able to show upto 90% extinction of an incident field that is resonant with the exciton
transition in a single monolayer of MoSe2. The corresponding reflection coefficient was found to be
45% which is only limited by the decay rates and sample quality. Additionally, this monolayer is
embedded in a charge controlled heterostructure that can be used to realize an electrically tunable
atomically-thin mirror. This paves way to applications such as fast programmable spatial light
modulators, chiral mirrors, suspended ultra-light mirrors for optomechanical devices and many
more.
