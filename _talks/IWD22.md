This talk was part of the 2-day [International Women’s Day Conference](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/international-womens-day-conference-2022-mariam-hussain/?trackingId=tPAiNUltShCRQ%2BzwZXuvZQ%3D%3D) 
organized by Pakistani Women in Computing (PWiC) and Google’s Women Techmakers program. My talk motivated the exciting merge of Quantum computing and machine learning. I also presented surveys that show how
women make less than 20% of the people in computing, engineering, and physics. Physics had the lowest number of women at all levels of education and employment. When it comes to identifying challenges, 
barriers, and success, interesting social differences can be identified across the two genders. See the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AwnTYYzGFU)
