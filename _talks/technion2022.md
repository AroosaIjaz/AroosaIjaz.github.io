I talked about the promises and current state of Quantum artificial intelligence. I also discussed the challenges women face in STEM, their severe under-representation in Physics and highlighted the social, economical and cultural factors that might dosciurage them from working in this field. I also shared my personal experiences in academia and industry as a young female researcher.  See details [here](https://www.technioncanada.org/events/research-to-reality/)
