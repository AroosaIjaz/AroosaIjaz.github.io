At this symposium hosted by Technion Canada, I talked about the promises and current state of Quantum artificial intelligence. I introduced the history and development of quantum mechanics and the birth of quantum computing. The current state of NISQ devices and recently reported quantum advantage results were discussed. Then, I gave an overview of how machine learning and quantum computing can support and work with each other and gave various algortihmic examples.  

I also discussed the challenges women face in STEM, their severe under-representation in Physics and highlighted the social, economical and cultural factors that might discourage them from working in this field. I also shared my personal experiences regarding growing up in Pakistan as an aspiring female scientist and my experiences so far in quantum academia and industry.
