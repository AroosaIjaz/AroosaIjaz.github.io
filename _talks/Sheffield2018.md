Monolayer TMDCs have recently appeared as fascinating non-centrosymmetric systems to explore quantum physics. Additionally, a direct
band gap, Ising spin-orbit coupling and the corresponding spin-valley locking can proof promising research grounds for topological
superconductivity. In this project, we look into the effects of proxmitizing hole-doped TMDCs (mainly WSe2) with an s-wave superconductor
and the corresponding transport of cooper pairs via the inter-valley paired state with a chern number 2.
For this purpose, we make hetrostructures using two flakes of 10-50nm thick exfoliated NbSe2 to proximitize and measure transport across
a S-I-S junction. NbSe2 not only provides atomically flat interfaces but also its work function lies close to the valence band of WSe2.
Clean fabrication and interfaces are immensely crucial to observing any proximitized superconductivity in WSe2. In our cleanest samples,
below-superconducting-gap features arising from Andreev Reflections were observed as first signatures of induced superconductivity in WSe2
(the superconducting gap of NbSe2 is 1meV and its critical magnetic field is 4T). This work is in progress towards detecting Majorana
Fermions at the 2D semiconductor-superconductor interfaces.
