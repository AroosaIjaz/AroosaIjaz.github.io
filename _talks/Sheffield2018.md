Monolayer TMDCs have recently appeared as fascinating non-centrosymmetric systems to explore quantum physics. Additionally, a direct
band gap, Ising spin-orbit coupling and the corresponding spin-valley locking can proof promising research grounds for topological
superconductivity. In this project, we look into the effects of proxmitizing hole-doped TMDCs (mainly WSe2) with an s-wave superconductor
and the corresponding transport of cooper pairs via the inter-valley paired state with a chern number 2.
For this purpose, we make hetrostructures using two flakes of 10-50nm thick exfoliated NbSe2 to proximitize and measure transport across
a S-I-S junction. Below-superconducting-gap features arising from Andreev Reflections were observed as first signatures of induced superconductivity. This work is in progress towards detecting Majorana
Fermions at the 2D semiconductor-superconductor interfaces.
