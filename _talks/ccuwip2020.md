This was a wonderful opportunity for me to inspire brilliant young women about quantum computing! I gave an introductory talk on QML, discussed the gender bias in Physics and encouraged young students to take the lead. I also acted as a panel judge and attended presentations and poster sessions where students showcased their research. Had a great experience talking to everyone about physics, our motivations, and challenges! For deatils see, [ccuwip website](https://ccuwip.cap.ca/).
