Linear algebraic methods for machine learning, such as kernel methods, operate by
embedding data points as vectors in a high dimensional vector space, and by applying
methods of linear algebra to classify and to discriminate between embedded clusters
of data. Quantum mechanics represents a natural setting for enacting such linear
algebraic machine learning methods: data points can be embedded as quantum states
(which are by definition vectors in high-dimensional vector spaces) and quantum
computers can provide exponential speedups over classical computers for performing
the linear algebraic techniques required to classify and to discriminate between those
embedded states. This paper investigates the power of quantum embeddings for
machine learning. We identify the optimal measurements to discriminate between
clusters of data, and we show how to perform those measurements on existing
quantum computers. We show that the performance of such quantum classifiers is
completely determined by the quantum feature map that performs the embedding:
we use adaptive learning techniques to find optimal quantum feature maps. Because
of the phenomenon of quantum advantage, quantum embeddings are inaccessible to
classical computers. Consequently, hybrid devices that combine classical
preprocessing with quantum classification are strictly at least as powerful as classical
kernel methods alone. See talk [here](https://www.qtml2020.com/)
