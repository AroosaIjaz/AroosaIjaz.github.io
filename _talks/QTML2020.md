This talk is about the power of quantum embeddings for
machine learning. We identify the optimal measurements to discriminate between
clusters of data, and we show how to perform those measurements on existing
quantum computers. We show that the performance of such quantum classifiers is
completely determined by the quantum feature map that performs the embedding:
we use adaptive learning techniques to find optimal quantum feature maps.See talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgfLNmVfH1A&list=PLnfLBUr5sAbDC_3B1GG3u7yjzUIBKf3pa&index=14)
