Quantum Barsaat 2024 is a series of workshops on quantum computing organized by QPakistan in collaboration with QWorld. This workshop series is conducted online, is completely free, and open to any person. It aims at encouraging and educating high school, undergraduate, and graduate students about Quantum computing. I gave an intro lecture on quantum states and how we move from classical probabilistic computation to quantum computation. Lecture available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv7B9OgNP3M)
