In this accessible talk, I give an overview and current status of the field of Quantum learning theory. It helps us understand how QML models learn from data. It also includes a comprehensive intro to classical computational learning theory. This should be understandable by all levels of quantum enthusiasts and can be used with the notes I shared previously
