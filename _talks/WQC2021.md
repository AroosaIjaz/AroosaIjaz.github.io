In this accessible talk, I give an overview and current status of the field of Quantum learning theory. It helps us understand how QML models learn from data. It also includes a comprehensive introduction to classical computational learning theory. This should be understandable by all levels of quantum enthusiasts and can be used with my [notes](https://aroosaijaz.github.io/portfolio/Intro_QML/). The video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJgMQsskZx0&list=PLzwVBI2OzmEzOp8OAdhY5n1QCpR0M9mvo&index=7).
