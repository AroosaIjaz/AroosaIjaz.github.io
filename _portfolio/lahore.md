You can not choose where you are born. Growing up in Lahore in a sunni muslim family of the [chisti order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chishti_Order) is an unrepraceble experience that forms the foundation of who I am. 

I am extremely greatful for it. Yes, there are countless challenges at every step when you are born a woman in Pakistan. However, I do love the soul of the Punjabi culture I grew up in and want to share a bit about it here. 


Starting in the twelfth century, augmented by the formation of the [Delhi Sultanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate), teachings of Persian Islam and [Sufism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism) mixed with the Indian subcontinent life to create a uniquely beautiful culture of expression, contemplation, wandering dervishes, spirituality and love. 


Overall, along with praying, it emphasizes being selfless, sympathetic, generous and non-materialistic as a lifestyle. It teaches you about the meaninglessness of a vain life, to explore your own self, to let go of desires/ego and to respect and help every fellow creature as much as possible. It portrays love as a path to the Divine. Some philosophers advocated to live in poverty and to suffer adversity to ease life for others.  


In short, it teaches you to put love at the core of your soul.


To this day, we sing songs, ghazals and Qawallis wrriten by poets like [Amir Khusrau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir_Khusrau), [Farid Ganjshakar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Farid), [Shahbaz qalandar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Shahbaz_Qalandar), [Rumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi) and [Iqbal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal). These songs are mostly about purification of self.  Additionally, Lahore has rich influnece from Sufi philosophers like [Nizamuddin Auliya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizamuddin_Auliya), [Moin-ud-Din Chisti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27in_al-Din_Chishti), [Ali Hijwari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_al-Hujwiri) and [Qutbuddin Bakhtiar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutbuddin_Bakhtiar_Kaki).
