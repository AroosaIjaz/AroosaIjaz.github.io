This has been a really hard year for everyone. The pandemic has thrown our inadequacies and meaninglessness of life into perspective. So much has changed and yet so much has not. I want to say that my life turned upside down but "How do you know that your life would not be better turned upside down?" said Shams-i-Tabrizi. 

I have had a complex relationship with change since I was a kid. While the most important thing for me was to learn new things and change my state of mind, I was always the controller of change. I got to decide what I learn, what I change inside me. Since a young age, I worked on myself, diligently tried to understand and question things around me, and made own system of beliefs rather than accepting what I was being socialized into. I isncerely beilieve in change but I also had to be the one in its control. With time, however, many life experiences and facts changed me or at least had power over me. In their wake, for a very long time, and to this day, I struggle with the unwanted and unwelcomed change. I long for the "normal". I know there are new unknown teritories. I want to reconnect with myself. Shamsi Tabirizi came to mind recently...whatever the changes, wanted or unwanted, it is all still myself and all I need to do is get to know the new things more.
