Do you know how many bodies of children and women are found in the trash every day around the world? How many are found in ditches and forests and and water bodies? and how many are never found at all?

What is the value of a woman to a man?

Are we the ones responsible for "male loneliness"? or are we the "old ball and chain"?

Are we important to you? or are our "feminine" traits and the female gender so low that you use it as a slur towards each other?

Are we the ones you fight for? or are we the ones you hurt and humiliate when you want to make your rampage of terror in wars and disputes?


From women who were mass raped and their vaginas stabbed with bayonets in [Nanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre) to women committing mass suicides in [Sudan](https://www.darfurwomenaction.org/press_release/over-120-civilians-killed-and-over-130-women-committed-suicide-to-escape-rape-by-rsf/) to avoid that same fate, to all the women and children's lives that are effected or lost daily because of violence perpetrated by you...how do we share this earth with you? Why do we have to pay the price for your insecurities, your made-up constructs of honor, your lust and your wars? How should we value you in return, if the value of any of us to any of you can be less than disposible trash?
