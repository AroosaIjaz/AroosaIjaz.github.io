Can men and women ever really connect?

We live very different lives and experiences. Can men really understand ours?

Is this about empathy (or lack thereof)? 

Is this about the power imbalance; the ones in power have to keep their eyes closed to the suffering to mantain the status quo? Because even men with empathy and kindness do not seem to be able to make themselves uncomfortable long enough to want to listen to our voices around them or care enough to hold other men accountable. The ones in power have to invalidate you to keep their previlige, right?

Is this built into the gender roles? 

Is this biological?

Or maybe it is a mix of all these factors? 





Why does it matter? 




Plenty of men and women are friends. Plenty of hetrosexual couples continue to find some way of living together and making families, whether they can find any actual companionship and understanding in each other or not. 

However, this underlying disconnect seems built into the very fabric of our current reality. Not just the human history. Have you noticed?





Can we co-share reponsibilities? Although women are working and earning more than ever before, men continue to do do less care-giving and housework and spend more time on leisure activities, even in families where women are the main bread winners [US-based 2023 report](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/04/13/in-a-growing-share-of-u-s-marriages-husbands-and-wives-earn-about-the-same/)! Moreover, married men have been shown to get higher earnings compared to married women, unmarried men and unmarried women [US-based 2019 report](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/second-quarter-2019/earnings-gap-marital-status-race-gender)!
  

Can girls have healthy childhoods? 650 million women alive today (one in five women) experienced sexual violence of some form BEFORE they turned 18 [Unicef 2023 report](https://www.reuters.com/world/one-eight-girls-women-raped-or-sexually-assaulted-before-age-18-unicef-says-2024-10-10/)!

Can we co-exist at home? 51,100 out of 85000 women that were intentionally killed by men in 2023 were killed by their male partner. That is 140 women a day! 1 woman every 10 minutes [UN 2023 report](https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2024/11/femicides-in-2023-global-estimates-of-intimate-partner-family-member-femicides)! 

Can we co-exist online? Roughly 51% of the women worldwide have experienced online harassment and abuse [UN Women 2024 report](https://knowledge.unwomen.org/en/articles/facts-and-figures/facts-and-figures-ending-violence-against-women)!



Most AI researchers I meet on a daily basis are men. If more women were in the room, I think a lot of the AI research progress and currently available AI products would have looked very different. For example, if men were thinking for both of us, generative AI which is now being used to create fake porn of female colleagues/class fellows would have gone through more scrutiny. 



There would have been more understanding of our health problems; Women's health continues to be an after thought in the medical community. For example, it may seem that pregnancy gets a lot of attention and services in most countries. Most mothers, after they give birth, report extremely grim experiences regarding the care given to them by both their medical doctors and their male partners.
