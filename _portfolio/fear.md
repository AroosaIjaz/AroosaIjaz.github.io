As soon as I could reason as a child, I could see shackles around me. shackles that were bigger than life. 
shackles around my ankles. shackles around my throat.
they become bigger and heavier with every momemt.
I saw every woman around me go through it too.
Some grow up thinking that these shackles are part of their bodies. they stop noticing them 
Some try and fight them in their rebellious teens and then succumb 
Some keep fighting them till they can get more wiggle room. The chains seem to get a bit longer and they can walk a bit farther

They knaw at you

They pain you

They defeat you

They keep you low

where do we go?

Every where you turn, you see walls. 

Every step you take, you feel the restraint fo the chains

Every where you look, every woman seems to be at the bottom of a well...either in pain or bracing for it

you want to reach out and save all of them but

where do we go?

When i was in high school, I worked on a project to design a self-sufficient colony in space, a fascinating theoretical idea
on paper. Placed at Lagrange points near earth, we could in principle have everything we need...I kept thinking about till many
years later...I still do...it gave me fantasy to mull over...a possible escape!should all women go there...will we be safe there...? 

where do we go?
