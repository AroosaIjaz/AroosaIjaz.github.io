As soon as I could reason as a child, I could see shackles around me

shackles around my ankles 

shackles around my throat

shackles that become bigger and heavier with every momemt

I desperately look around...every woman around me has her own...every one is drowning...

shackles that are bigger than life

Some of us grow up thinking that these shackles are part of our bodies...we stop noticing them. Some of us try and fight them in our rebellious teens and then succumb. Some of us keep fighting them till we can get some wiggle room. The chains seem to get a bit longer and allow one to walk a bit farther before pulling back

They knaw at you

They pain you

They defeat you

They keep you low

where do we go?

Every where you turn, you see walls 

Every step you take, you feel the restraint from the chains

where do we go?

When I was in high school, I worked on a project to design a self-sufficient human colony in space, a fascinating theoretical idea. Placed at Lagrange points near earth, we could in principle have everything we need...I kept thinking about till many
years later...I still do...it gave me a fantasy to mull over...a possible escape! should all women go there...will we be safe there...? 


We are tired...of being your punching bag, of being your shame, of being your honor, of being your achievement, of being your vanity, of being defined through you

We are tired of your schackles
