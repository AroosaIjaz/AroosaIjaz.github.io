As soon as I could reason as a child, I could see shackles around me

shackles that were bigger than life

shackles around my ankles 

shackles around my throat

shackles that become bigger and heavier with every momemt

I desperately looked around...every woman around me had her own...Some grow up thinking that these shackles are part of their bodies...Some try and fight them in their rebellious teens and then succumb...Some keep fighting them till they can get more wiggle room. The chains seem to get a bit longer and they can walk a bit farther before they are pulled back

They knaw at you

They pain you

They defeat you

They keep you low

where do we go?

Every where you turn, you see walls. 

Every step you take, you feel the restraint fo the chains

where do we go?

When I was in high school, I worked on a project to design a self-sufficient colony in space, a fascinating theoretical idea. Placed at Lagrange points near earth, we could in principle have everything we need...I kept thinking about till many
years later...I still do...it gave me fantasy to mull over...a possible escape! should all women go there...will we be safe there...? 


We are tired...of being your punching bag, of being your shame, of being your honor, of being your achivement, of being your vanity, of being defined through you

We are tired of your schackles
