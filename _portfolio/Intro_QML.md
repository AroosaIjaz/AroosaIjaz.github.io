Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly emerging field of immense industrial and scientific
interest. It beautifully merges the ideas and applications of machine learning with the enigmatic
principles of quantum physics. These notes summarize the basic concepts of QML that I wrote in January 2021.
They can be treated as a comprehensive first step or introduction to the field and contain detailed references
that have been divided according to topic. I am sharing them here in case it helps anyone else.
