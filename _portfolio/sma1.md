I have been looking into how the Canadian legal system is setup to deal with crimes of sexual violence.

This eye-opening quest started when I met the author of this book at a social event recently: [The story of Jane Doe : a book about rape](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM225940&R=225940). She became the first person in history to not only fight to get legal representaion in her own rape case but also to file a civil lawsuit against Toronto police for Charter breaches and negligence, which she successfully won after 11 years of legal battles ([case summary here](https://books.openedition.org/uop/544)). 

Only 5-6% of all such sexual assault crimes are reported to the police, while 50% of all Canadian women have experienced at least one incident of sexual or physical assault in their lifetime ([source](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-002-x/2024001/article/00007-eng.htm)). Why?

There are an insane number of problems and perspectives to look at in this topic, from child sexual abuse (their testimonies are more likely to be discredited by defense lawyers) to religious and ethnicity influences (Canadian native women are 4 times more likely to experience sexual assaul. South Asian muslim women are many folds less likely to report such crimes) to analyzing what prison time convictions do to "fix" this issue...

I share here the presentation (first of many) I made for a non-profit I am working for right now. I narrowed down to one very particular problem that I think can have broader impact and is likely solvable: trial setup and lack of legal representation for the victims. 
[MALPRACTICES IN THE CANADIAN LEGAL SYSTEM AROUND SEXUAL VIOLENCE [PDF]](http://AroosaIjaz.github.io/files/Session2_SMA.pdf)

Do you know that if you experience sexual violence and report it to the police, in case it goes to trial (not highly likely - see presentation), you do not get any legal representation? The accused person does. The case is setup as "Crown vs the accused"; an antiquated setup from centuries ago that continues to fail us to this day. You are only brought in as a witness to be questioned. You do not get to see or participate or input in the trial of your own assault in any way. You have no legal way to voice your questions, concerns, interests, needs, discomforts or expectations. If you are not trained in law (which is true for most of us), you might not even understand what the trial and lawyers are doing or saying to you. The Crown lawyer that presents the evidence of the case has nothing to do with you. They do not represent you; they represent the state. You are not given any legal advice or explanations (unless you seek it out yourself from NGOs or third parties in the community).    

This flawed setup naturally creates another problem: an environment where the defence attorneys for the accused get their time to shine. To keep their professional reputation, the trial becomes more about their chance to "win" and prove their abilities; nothing is off the table for them in this "game". 

Let us look at an example: let us say you report one such crime but do not want to be a part of anything to do with it anymore. you think you have done the right thing by reporting it but you dont want to relive it or be part of it publically or in any other way. you just hope the bad person is caught and can not hurt anyone else. you might want to take time to deal with your trauma and new fears. Maybe you feel that you can not possibly discuss your experience in a public setting. You give detailed accounts to the police, doctors and the social workers involved. Now, if the case goes to trial, (you dont know if and when because the investigation and all related matters are kept private), and if you are hesitant to go to the court as the witness, you can be put in jail for "obstruction". Your multiple testimonies given to the police and Crown lawyer are not deemed enough. You have to be brought in and questioned...And questioned again and again and again - in case a hole can be pushed through somewhere in your account or your discomfort at reliving your assault in front of the court can be used to label you "unstable" or you can be discredited in some way by the defence lawyer. This is not a made-up example sadly but the current reality...victims being threatened, detained or even jailed  by the legal system is not uncommon. An example: [jailed victim](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/sex-assault-victim-jailed-ganley-1.4146682)

How does any of this make sense to us a "civilised" society? Instead of ensuring justice, I think this setup is inherently illogical, discriminatory and unfair. This is a huge factor in why so many victims of this particular crime are hesitant to go to the police. This is also evident in the very stark difference in [crime statistics for sexual violence vs physical violence](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-002-x/2017001/article/54870-eng.htm).   

I will continue to share my journey here as I dive deeper into this project.
