I have been looking into how the Canadian legal system is setup to deal with crimes of sexual violence.

This eye-opening quest started when I met the author of this book at a social event recently: [The story of Jane Doe : a book about rape](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM225940&R=225940)

Only 5-6% of all such crimes are reported to the police, while 50% of all Canadian women have experienced at least one incident of sexual or physical assault in their lifetime ([source](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-002-x/2024001/article/00007-eng.htm)). 

There are an insane number of problems and perspectives to look at in this topic, from child sexual abuse (their testimonies are more likely to be discredited by defense lawyers) to religious and ethnicity influences (Canadian native women are 4 times more likely to experience sexual assaul. South Asian muslim women are many folds less likely to report such crimes) to what can the punishments and prison time convictions really do to "fix" this issue...

I share here the presentation (first of many) I made for a non-profit I am working for right now. I narrowed down to one very particular problem that I think can have broader impact and is likely solvable: trial setup and lack of legal representation for the victims. 

Do you know that if you experience sexual violence and report it to the police, in case it goes to trial (already not highly likely - see presentation), you do not get any legal representation. The accused person does. The case is setup as Crown vs the accused; an antiquated setup from centuries ago that continues to fail us to this day. You are only brought in as a witness to be questioned. You do not get to see or participate or input in the trial of your own assault in any way. 

This setup creates another problem: the defence attorneys for the accused get their time to shine. Their chance to "win" and prove their abilities; nothing is off the table for them in this "game". 

Let us look at an example: let us say you report one such crime but do not want to be a part of anything to do with it anymore. you think you have done the right thing by reporting it but you dont want to relive it or be part of it publically or in any other way. you just hope the bad person is caught and can not hurt anyone else. Maybe you do not feel you can possibly discuss it in a public setting but give detailed accouints to the police and social workers. If the case goes to trial, (you dont know if and when because the investigation and all related matters are kept private), if you are hisitant to go to the court as the witness, you can be put in jail for "obstruction". Your multiple testimonies to the police and Crown lawyer will not be deemed enough. You have to be brought in and questioned again and again and again - in case a hole can be pushed through somewhere in your account or you can be discredited in some way by the defence lawyer. This is not a made-up example sadly and not unheard of: [jailed victim](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/sex-assault-victim-jailed-ganley-1.4146682)

How does any of this make sense to us a "civilised" society? Instead of ensuring justice, i think this setup is inherently illogical, discrimanotory and unfair. 

I will continue to share my journey here as I dive deeper into this project.
