I have been looking into how the Canadian legal system is setup to deal with crimes of sexual violence.

This eye-opening quest started when I met the author of this book at a social event recently: [The story of Jane Doe : a book about rape](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM225940&R=225940)

Only 5-6% of all such crimes are reported to the police, while 50% of all Canadian women have experienced at least one incident of sexual or physical assault in their lifetime ([source](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-002-x/2024001/article/00007-eng.htm)). 

There are an insane number of problems and perspectives to look at in this topic, from child sexual abuse (their testimonies are more likely to be discredited by defense lawyers) to religious and ethnicity influences (Canadian native women are 4 times more likely to experience sexual assaul. South Asian muslim women are many folds less likely to report such crimes).

I share here the presentation (first of many) I made for a non-profit I am working for right now. I narrowed down to one very particular problem that I think can have broader impact and is likely solvable (trial setup and lack of legal representation for the victims).

I will continue to share my journey here as I dive deeper into this project.
