If I come to you and tell you that you need to take a pill. 
The reasons are multi-layered. 
You will feel sick for some months but it is also so pertinant that you do this. 
It is very important for the familial and social fabric that you do this. It is for the greater good.
In the long scheme of things, you will be thankful you went through it. It will give your life meaning.
It is only a few months of inconvenience. It will be very rewarding in the end. For everyone, especially for you. 
And you will get lots of attention and help if you do decide to take the pill...while you keep taking it.

Will you take it? 

How would you feel 20 years down the line when you realize that the pill actually had life-long effects that you were never made aware of? That there is no going back. 

Do you think you are more likely to take on this endeavour if you are kept in the dark about the long-term effects on your body and health? Would you still like to know about the potential side-effects even you are confident that they wont effect you? that you are not going to be part of the statistics but maybe it will effect half of your friends if they took the pill I am offering?

Do you think you might still take on this endeavour even if I were to educate you on the side-effects honestly and sincerely? Maybe you can prepare yourself better and take on the needed precautions if you know more? Maybe you want to check your family health history once again?

Do you think it is at least good to have the choice? 

Rather than feeling used, would it be better if I care about your humanity and your bodily autonomy?

The moral of this story: making an educated choice motivated by your own experiences and life is better than the one you are forced to make in the dark.


This is the story of every woman who has or wants to have children...


We are not new to exclusion and marginalisation as women....we have centuries to catch up on.

In a time where AI robot girlfriends are already available for men, we still dont know much about women's health. I suppose it is easier for men to do this than to unlearn or to let go of the convenience dehumanisation of women brings them. 

While talking to my mother about recent changes in her health, I realised that one of the problems she is dealing with comes directly from giving birth to a large number of children. She (or her doctor) never connected it to that. Her doctor resorted to the usual insulting behavior of invalidation. Told her to "avoid stress" and to seek psychological help instead. Something most of us women are very accustomed to when interacting with the medical field...or the wider society...


[Recent research](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(23)00454-0/fulltext) on pregnancy and childbirth has shown that their effects are not only limited to the few months after giving birth. A large number effects are life-long and appear in various ways decades afterwards.

And I dont see this being discussed anywhere; neither the popular media nor the doctor offices women go to get counselling and medical help.



The power of knowledge and choice is seemingly kept out of reach of half the population on this planet...

Seems like external elements have decided that it is better to make you have children in the dark...
