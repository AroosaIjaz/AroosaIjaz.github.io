Growing up in Pakistan, it was drilled into my every waking moment that I have to be continously concious of my "modesty". 

Our daily clothing is a three part dress made of a pajama (preferably loose fitting), a long shirt (preferably loose fitting, with full sleeves and down to knees) and a large shawl on top. Every dress is made that way, more or less. While the rules and strictness can vary a bit from family to family, the first and mostly the biggest characterising judgement is how well a girl can hide herself within her dress. That is what makes the foundation of a "good woman". 

Since I was 6 or 7 years old, a constant part of my stream of thought was to be aware of myself and to wrap the shawl around myself to further cover any hints of the shape of my body...


EVERY MOMENT IS CONDITIONED AND EXAMINED FROM THE MOMENT YOU ARE BORN: Even for young girls, modesty should hold while you are sweeping the floor in the house OR when you are climbing into your school bus OR while you are answering a question on the black board in a classroom OR when you drop something and have to bend down to pick it up OR while you are sleeping....there is no break. you are always on display and hence always up for judgement and discipline.    


And it is not just the dressing part...are you talking too loud? are you sitting "in a bad way"? are you laughing too hard or too loud? are you walking too "provocatively"? are your foot steps making sound on the ground? are you crying "too much"? why is your hair open?  

Since you exist, you are always up to tempt any man around you. So every moment of your life can only involve either teaching you to be "modest" or protecting you from "bad men"... 


**As a woman, you live through men's lens...on men's conditions...to serve men...in a man's world.**


“Male fantasies, male fantasies, is everything run by male fantasies? Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, it's all a male fantasy: that you're strong enough to take what they dish out, or else too weak to do anything about it. Even pretending you aren't catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you're unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else. You are a woman with a man inside watching a woman. You are your own voyeur.”
― **Margaret Atwood, The Robber Bride** 


I still struggle with this on a daily basis. I am still learning how not to be my own voyeur...


“A woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. Whilst she is walking across a room or whilst she is weeping at the death of her father, she can scarcely avoid envisaging herself walking or weeping. From earliest childhood she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. And so she comes to consider the surveyor and the surveyed within her as the two constituent yet always distinct elements of her identity as a woman. She has to survey everything she is and everything she does because how she appears to men, is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another....


One might simplify this by saying: men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. This determines not only most relations between men and women but also the relation of women to themselves. The surveyor of woman in herself is male: the surveyed female. Thus she turns herself into an object -- and most particularly an object of vision: a sight.”
